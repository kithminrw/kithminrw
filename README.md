### Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> I'm [Kithmin](https://www.kithminrw.com/)

I have a Master's (MASc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from The University of British Columbia. I studied Biomedical Engineering as an Undergrad. I like to work on interesting projects in the areas of ASIC Design, Silicon Photonics and PIC Design, Electronics, Robotics, Integrated Sensing, Wearable Devices, and Machine Learning Tools for Hardware Design Automation (EDA/EPDA) and Simulation.

- ðŸ”­ For my MASC, I worked on designing sensors on Silicon Photonics Chips and Microfluidic Control Systems [[Read my thesis]](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0445597).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kithminrw@gmail.com
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects at the intersection of Machine Learning, Biomedical Engineering, and PIC/ASIC Hardware Design Automation. I have collaborated on [gdsfactory](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/) during an internship and collaborated on projects for [SiEPIC](https://github.com/SiEPIC) during my Master's.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love working on open-source hardware and DIY projects :)

- [SINDiB Micromouse Project](https://github.com/sanjith1999/SINDiB-MicroMouse)
  - The project was taken forward by a group of undergraduates in 2023, creating the above knowledge base. I hope this project serves as a resource for more micromouse projects to come. 
- A talk on Micromouse Robots given by me in 2022 is available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EzACgUfxd5gQGBXqCMkfpz_SdqEy7rfr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110067105344034357131&rtpof=true&sd=true). 
- Contact me if you are interested in designing a micromouse; I am hoping to put up a proper repository on the micromouse project in the future after I design a new version of this project.

### Other Projects & Initiatives
- [Development of a Cost-effective sEMG Sensor System for Controlling Bionic Arms](https://github.com/Laknath1996/sEMG-Hand-Gesture-Recognition) 
  - Undergraduate thesis project
  - The goal is to develop a cost-effective solution for individual finger based wireless interaction using sEMG technology, for amputees and all other users. This device is aimed to be a revolutionary new wearable technology with many applications, mainly being for Bionic Hand Control.
  - Published: [ICASSP paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054227) | [SMC paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9283285)
- [Bionic Humanoid Arm and EMG recording device using R-Pi 3](https://github.com/kithminrw/EMG_RPi_BionicHand)
  - Created a low-cost device and circuit using AD623 for obtaining Bio-potentials using a R-Pi protoboard for recording EMG Signals. Bionic Hand was completely 3-D printed and developed using nylon strings and servo motors mounted on the arm. This project was awarded a Distinction pass after it was presented as a Self Initiated Innovation project, which was expanded into the FYP under the supervision Dr. Simon Lind Kappel.
- [Automated Plant Leaf Disease Detection](https://github.com/kahnchana/Plant_Disease_Recognition)
  - First project that ever amounted to anything.
  - Used multi-spectral image feeds (NIR/RGB spectra) and implemented transfer learning-based training of CNNs on small datasets of domain-specific images. The product was deployed using a mobile app with edge inference and recognized as a Top Initiative at the National Tech Awards.

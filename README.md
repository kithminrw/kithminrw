### Hi <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> I'm [Kithmin](https://www.kithminrw.com/)

I'm a Masters Student (MASc) in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at The University of British Columbia. I studied Biomedical Engineering as an Undergrad. I like to work on interesting projects in the areas of ASIC Design, Silicon Photonics and PIC Design, Electronics, Robotics, Integrated Sensing, Wearable Devices, and Machine Learning Tools for Hardware Design Automation (EDA/EPDA) and Simulation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on designing sensors on Silicon Photonics Chips and Microfluidic Control Systems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: kithminrw@gmail.com
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects at the intersection of Machine Learning, Biomedical Engineering, and PIC/ASIC Hardware Design Automation. I have collaborated on [gdsfactory](https://gdsfactory.github.io/gdsfactory/) during an internship and collaborated on projects for [SiEPIC](https://github.com/SiEPIC) during my Master's.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I find myself being more drawn to software+AI than to hardware as I grow older. But I want to continue doing open-source hardware and DIY projects :)

  - Published: [ICASSP paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9054227) | [SMC paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9283285)
- [Bionic Humanoid Arm and EMG recording device using R-Pi 3](https://github.com/kithminrw/EMG_RPi_BionicHand)
  - Created a low-cost device and circuit using AD623 for obtaining Bio-potentials using a R-Pi protoboard for recording EMG Signals. Bionic Hand was completely 3-D printed and developed using nylon strings and servo motors mounted on the arm. This project was awarded a Distinction pass after it was presented as a Self Initiated Innovation project, which was expanded into the FYP under the supervision Dr. Simon Lind Kappel.
- [Automated Plant Leaf Disease Detection](https://github.com/kahnchana/Plant_Disease_Recognition)
  - First project that ever amounted to anything.
  - Used multi-spectral image feeds (NIR/RGB spectra) and implemented transfer learning based training of CNNs on small datasets of domain-specific images. The product was deployed using a mobile app with edge inference and recognized as a Top Initiative at National Tech Awards.
